## Hi there, I'm Benoît Baguelin 👋

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at [ENSEA](https://ensea.fr/), a French graduate school specializing in electrical engineering and computer science. My interests span the full spectrum of technology, from low-level hardware design to high-level software development, with a focus on software engineering, embedded systems, and cybersecurity.

![Sabotime](./img/sabotime.png)

Sabotime is my main web project. It’s an online multiplayer game inspired by the board game Time Bomb. I developed the game entirely, both frontend and backend, with graphic elements created in collaboration with a team and professional designers. This project includes 3D graphics, live chat, account creation, and all the features that make it a complete game. The game was a real success, remaining online for about a month and attracting around 500 unique users. The game is no longer live due to legal reasons.

![La Glycine](./img/laglycine.png)

At the age of 16, I created my second showcase website, which is still in use today. This site highlights and promotes vacation rentals in Normandy. One of its key features is a small administration panel, including password-protected login and a database, enabling the publication of short posts directly on the site. This project provided me with an introduction to system security.
