### **My Projects** ðŸ’»

- [**Sabotime**](https://sabotime.com)  
Sabotime is my main web project. Itâ€™s an online multiplayer game inspired by the board game Time Bomb. I developed the game entirely, both frontend and backend, with graphic elements created in collaboration with a team and professional designers. This project includes 3D graphics, live chat, account creation, and all the features that make it a complete game. The game was a real success, remaining online for about a month and attracting around 500 unique users. The game is no longer live due to legal reasons.
- [**Rando Audio**](https://rando-audio.fr/)  
The Rando Audio project is the graduation project of Simon NÃ¶lp. Itâ€™s an interactive audio story where the listener can make choices and shape their own adventure.
- [**Student Union Website**](https://bde.asso-ensea.fr/)  
In 2024, I developed the website for my student union, the BDE. Serving as the association's online showcase, the site was built using the Next.js framework, providing a modern and efficient platform to represent our activities.
- [**Tourist rentals Website**](https://lagycine-asnelles.fr)  
At the age of 16, I created my second showcase website, which is still in use today. This site highlights and promotes vacation rentals in Normandy. One of its key features is a small administration panel, including password-protected login and a database, enabling the publication of short posts directly on the site. This project provided me with an introduction to system security.
